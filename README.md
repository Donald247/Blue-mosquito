Real time chess video tracker

    I aim to implement an automated system to interpret live video footage provided via a side mounted webcam, either within a laptop or on a similarly heighted non-intrusive mount. This software will be able to determine the exact series of moves played within a game in the form of chess co-ordinates algebra. With this collected data, implementation areas include:
  
      •	Providing move input to a Chess AI software, which itself will output its own move in reply. (Main goal)
      •	Sending of live data across the internet, allowing for word wide physical chess games.
      •	Tracking of multiple chess games in a tournament environment.
      •	Analysis of previous games after inputting into Chess analysis software.
